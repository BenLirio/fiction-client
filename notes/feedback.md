# Feedback

These are the things that consultants will be looking at, and giving you
feedback on, after you've submitted your project.

## Project Workflow

-   **Planning** : Did you complete user stories and wireframes before you
    started writing code? Did you create a schedule for yourself to keep your
    project on track?
-   **Source Control** : Did you use source control to keep track of changes in
    your project and make regular 'save points' for yourself?

## Deliverables

-   **Technical Requirements** : Does your project meet all the technical
    requirements outlined above? Does it run?
-   **Software Design/Problem Solving** : How did you break up the functionality
    of your application? How did you solve the problems that you encountered
    along the way? Do the solutions you came up with make sense, from the
    perspective of industry best practices? How well can you defend the choices
    you've made?
-   **Code Clarity** : Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
    covered in class, such as spacing and semantic naming? Did you comment your
    code as your s as we have in class?
-   **Creativity** : Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your
    project submission? Is the finished product something of value to the end
    user, in addition to being functional (not just a login button and an index
    page)?
